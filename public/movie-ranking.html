<h2> Top three movie I have seen</h2>
<hr />
<h3>24</h3>
<p>This is my all time best movie. <br />
I love the story line, actions, characters and clarity. I would recommend this above any other series</p>
<h3>Blacklist</h3>
<p>This is another interested series I 've seen. The life of a man playing infused together in a single man.<br /> A terrorist, cunning and loving father. </p>
<h3>Nikita</h3>
<p>Nikita is a story of an ophan taking by secret government agency and trained to become a dangerous assassin. Trained to be invisible and think out of the box to fit into and escape from any situation.<br /> I would recommend this movie for anybody who likes action and technology all combined in a storyline</p>
